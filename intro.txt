Welcome to the Shader Dome!

The Shader Dome has no security so please play nice!

You can play with the Shader Dome by putting a GLSL program in the shaders folder. Format is vaguely based on ShaderToy.

Example program (paints half the dome red):

vec4 mainImage() {
    return vec4(tex_coords.x ? 0.5 ? 1.0 : 0.0. 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
}

There are a variety of variables defined for you:
tex_coords	x,y position
time		current time

Audio reactive variables (some of these aren't very useful!):
fft_tex		FFT of audio, 1D texture (vec2 complex values)
expfft_tex	smoothed lower precision FFT, 1D texture (float values)
rms		audio volume estimate
specflux        beat detection, frequency binned (array of 8 floats)
specavg		beat detection, overall (float)

ShaderToy compatiable variables:
iTime		current time
iResolution	screen resolution
fragCoord 	tex_coords * iResolution

Textures
You can define 2D textures like this (note "binding =" changes):

// tex tex/domegrid.png
layout(set = 1, binding = 0) uniform sampler2D iChannel0;

// tex tex/stars.png
layout(set = 1, binding = 1) uniform sampler2D iChannel1;

You can add images but they must be 8-bit RGBA PNGs. Please don't add anything that might violate the CoC!

Have a look at the other programs, and the file prefix.glsl for more info.

Have fun!
